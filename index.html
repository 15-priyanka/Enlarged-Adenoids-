<title>Enlarged Adenoids</title>

<h1 class="first" style="font-variant: uppercase;">Enlarged Adenoids</h1>
<h3><marquee>Adenoids are small patches of tissue located at the back of the throat. They are similar to the tonsils and located right above them</marquee></h3>

<h3 class="third">CAUSES</h3>
<p>Adenoids are present at birth. They grow until a child is between the ages of 3 and 5. Normally, they begin to shrink after around age 7. They shrink considerably in adulthood.</p>
<p>They’re located in the passage that connects the back of the nasal cavity to the throat. They produce antibodies to help your body fight off infections. During the early years, adenoids help protect infants from infection by trapping bacteria and viruses that enter the body through the nose.</p>
<p>Adenoids that become infected usually become enlarged, but return to their normal size when the infection subsides. However, in some instances, the adenoids remain enlarged even after the infection is gone.</p>
<p>Enlarged adenoids can also be caused by allergies. Some children have enlarged adenoids from birth.</p>

	<h3 class="third">SYMPTOMS</h3>
<p>Enlarged adenoids can cause a number of symptoms, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>blocked, stuffy nose
<li>ear problems
<li>problems sleeping
<li>snoring
<li>sore throat
<li>difficulty swallowing
<li>swollen glands in the neck
<li>problems breathing through the nose
“glue ear,” or otitis media with effusion (fluid buildup in the middle ear, which can cause hearing problems)
cracked lips and dry mouth (from breathing problems)
sleep apnea (pauses in breathing during sleep)</li>


</ul>

<h3 class="third">DIAGNOSIS</h3>
<p>The doctor will first ask about the symptoms your child is experiencing. Then your child will receive a physical exam. The doctor will use a special mirror and insert a small, flexible telescope (known as an endoscope) through the nose to view the adenoids.</p><p>

Depending on what your doctor finds, your child may need a blood test to check for infection. In some cases, an X-ray exam of the throat may be necessary.</p><p>

In severe cases, your child may need to undergo a sleep study. This will determine if they’re suffering from sleep apnea. During the study, your child will sleep overnight at a facility while their breathing and brain activity are monitored using electrodes. The study is painless, but it can be difficult for some children to sleep in a strange place.</p>

	<h3 class="third">TREATMENTS</h3>
<p>Treatment depends on how severe the condition is. If your child’s enlarged adenoids aren’t infected, the doctor may not recommend surgery. Instead, the doctor may choose to simply wait and see if the adenoids shrink on their own as your child gets older.</p><p>

In other cases, your doctor may recommend medication, such as a nasal steroid, to shrink enlarged adenoids. However, it’s common for enlarged adenoids to be removed if they continue to cause problems despite treatment with medications. The procedure is fairly simple and doesn’t have many risks. This surgery is called an adenoidectomy.</p>
